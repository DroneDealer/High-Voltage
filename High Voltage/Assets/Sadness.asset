  Ingredientdescription: "An emotional reaction produced when something valued is
    lost or unreachable. Humans describe it as a heaviness behind the ribs and a
    slowing of thoughts. It seems to pull their attention inward, encouraging reflection
    rather than action. Although unpleasant, sadness appears to help humans learn
    and heal. I cannot replicate the physical sensations, but I find the logic of
    it\u2026 elegant, almost phoenix-like."
