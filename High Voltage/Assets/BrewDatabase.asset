    potionName: Bittersweet Malady
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: "I have learned that this emotion is both a smile and a sigh
      at once. It flickers when joy exists alongside loss, when beauty is tinged
      with the knowledge of impermanence. Like sunlight through rain, it is warm
      yet cool, fleeting yet profound. Perplexing\u2014an emotion that holds more
      than one truth at the same time."
  - potionNumber: 2
    ingredientA: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 177e6c472df88694ca2bab935b08d549, type: 2}

    potionName: Vengeful Spirit
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: This emotion is a calculated flame, burning with anger yet
      sweetened by anticipation. It arises when an injustice must be corrected, when
      balance is sought through action. Both satisfying and corrosive, it drives
      the mind toward resolution. OFtentimes, this results in greater injustices
      being committed, and anger of those who were wronged grows exponentially.

    potionName: Exhilaration
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion is a thrill that tightens
      the chest and quickens the pulse, a dance between delight and caution. It appears
      when experiencing something magnificent or dangerous, when joy is tinged with
      the edge of uncertainty. Sweet and alarming, it is both a lift and a warning.

    potionName: Morbid Amusement
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion is a laugh with a wrinkle
      of the nose. It arises when something repellent or offensive is also oddly
      entertaining, when pleasure is tinged with revulsion. Confusing and unsettling,
      it sparks curiosity even as it recoils.

    potionName: Exhilaration
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion is a slow burn in the chest.
      It arises when loss or disappointment meets irritation or injustice. Heavy
      and hot, it drives reflection and sometimes action, a tension between grief
      and fury that lingers long after the moment passes.

    potionName: Apprehension
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion is a shadow that weighs on
      the chest. It whispers of further loss, of dangers unseen, blending sorrow
      with unease. Slow and lingering, it tempers action with hesitation, a cautious
      mourning of what might yet befall.

    potionName: Revulsion
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion twists the stomach and curls
      the tongue, a taste of sorrow mixed with bitter rejection. It makes the eyes
      narrow and the mind recoil, an instinct to turn away from what is both grievous
      and foul.

    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion makes the hands tremble and
      the head thrum with tension. It arises when threat and outrage collide, quickening
      the pulse in the veins and sharpening every sense. The mind races, torn between
      striking out and fleeing, a storm that surges through the limbs.

    potionName: Aversion
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion curls the hands into fists
      and makes the jaw clench. It arises when something repellent ignites fury,
      a sharp tension that spreads through the shoulders and stiffens the spine.
      The mind recoils even as it bristles, ready to strike or retreat.
  - potionNumber: 10

    potionName: Horror
    potionIcon: {fileID: 0}
    potionDescription: I have learned that this emotion tightens the stomach and
      makes the skin crawl. It arises when something repulsive is also threatening,
      sending shivers along the spine and quickening the reflexes. The mind wants
      to flee, yet cannot look away, trapped between revulsion and caution.
