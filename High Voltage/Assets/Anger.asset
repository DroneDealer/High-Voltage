  Ingredientdescription: I have learned that this emotion is a storm contained within
    the chest. It rises suddenly, sharp as fire, hot enough to blur reason and scorch
    patience. It comes from frustration, from injustice, from being blocked or betrayed.
    It is both destructive and energizing, a force that demands release, yet leaves
    a residue of confusion in its wake.
